# Robo spider
Repository for hosting a hobbyst spider robot project.

The project is built around a Raspberry Pi Pico development board.
 
It's also using Cytron Maker Drive DC engine control board, HCSR-04 ultrasonic distance sensor and a bidirectional logic level shifting board.
The movement and mehcanics is based on DC motors and mechanics from two DFRobot Spider Robot kits.
The power supply is a cheap 3,7 V LiPol battery - currently 2200 mAh.

I'm also using a TP4056 LiPol charger.

For the connections I'm using some cheap chinese cables, two medium sized solderless breadboards and 4 electrical quick couplers.
